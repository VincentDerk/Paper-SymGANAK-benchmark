Battleship problems, copied from [miniSAT-SPFS Github source](https://github.com/JoD/minisat-SPFS/tree/master/cnf%20test%20files/battleship)

We assume the description of these problems matches the one on the following webpage: http://kmkeen.com/battleship/index.html

"A type of puzzle called [Battleship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship_(puzzle)). It is based on the classic two player board game, but with slightly different rules and information. The wikipedia link talks about it more and presents examples. You are given information about the ships present and how many tiles are occupied by ships in a given row or column. This is similar to a nonogram however it is very common for some of the counts to be missing or for partial information about the contents of a square to be provided, so this solver will incorporate those features."
