They are very likely the same as these problems: https://www.cs.rochester.edu/u/kautz/Cachet/Model_Counting_Benchmarks/Grid.zip which are accompanied by the following description:

A grid network is an N x N grid, where there are two directed edges from a node to its neighbors right and down. The upper-left node is a source, and the bottom-right node is a sink. The query is to compute the probability of the sink being true given no evidence. The deterministic ratio is a parameter specifying the fraction of nodes that are deterministic, that is, whose values are determined given the values of their parents. There are 10 random instances generated for each size.

e.g. 50-10-1-q.cnf -> 50% of the nodes are deterministic, grid is order 10 (10x10 = 100 nodes)
