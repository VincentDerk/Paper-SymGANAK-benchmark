# Paper-SymGANAK
The problem instances (CNF) used to evaluate SymGANAK, a model counter introduced in AAAI2021 that exploits symmetry: Symmetric Component Caching for Model Counting on Combinatorial Instances by Timothy van Bremen, Vincent Derkinderen, Shubham Sharma, Subhajit Roy, Kuldeep S. Meel.

The code of this solver is available as a [branch of the GANAK solver](https://github.com/meelgroup/ganak/tree/symganak).


Some problem instances were available for research purposes by the respective authors, obtained from their website. Those problem instances have been left out of this repository and could be obtained by reading the README.md file in the respective directory. This is the case for:
* fpga/
* grid/
* MCNC-reduced/

For the remaining instances, there is a license in their directory.
