These problem instances were generated using the [CNFgen tool](https://massimolauria.net/cnfgen/). They are k-coloring graph problems. For each instance, you will find the graph (.graph) and the cnf (.cnf).

# Grid
The graphs form grids of size d x d. Problems were created using a combination of the following parameters: 
* d = [4..10] : size of grid
* k = [3,4] : amount of colors in k-coloring

# Random (gnm)
The graphs are randomly generated (--gnm n m = random graph with n nodes and m random edges) using a combination of the following parameters:
* n = [120, 125, 130]
* m = [150, 200, 250]
* k = [3]
using --seed 1.
